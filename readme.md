### Rationale for this project :
________

For this project, we were put in a team of 4, and we were asked to use all our new PHP skills, as well as everything we learned in front-end development (HTML, CSS and JS). This is the first fill stack project we've done.

Another reason for this project was to familiarize ourselves with MySQL and the SQL language. We had to learn how to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) data in a mysql database.

BreakingBadge is a functional prototype for editing and deleting badges. 

## What have we done?

One of the things we had to do for this project was to create accounts for users and admins. Depending on whether you are an admin or a user, you will see different things on the website and have different privileges.

There were many aspects to this project that we can first break down into front and back end tasks.


*Front-end:*
-------

The first half of our team took care of the creation of the home page, the login page and the content of the users' profiles once they successfully logged in. Once logged in, the user can see his profile and all the badges he has received.

Each user has a profile modal section where they can see their first name, last name and email address. 

The user also has the option of logging out of the account and returning to the login page. 

All the pages of our website also have different screen sizes, making it easily accessible and pleasant to look at.


*Back:*
------

The team worked on linking a PHPMyAdmin database composed of 3 tables to our website, and found out how to create, read, link, delete and modify data in our database, directly from the PHP website by connecting our PHP to the database via SQL. 

When entering the login page, the user can only login with an existing account created by an admin.


Here is a screenshot of the database and the structure of its tables : ! Database screenshot](includes/media/bdd.png)

***Important! *** There is also the possibility to login to our website as Admin. Admins do not have to go through the checkout process like students do, and they can also view the entry and exit history of any student of their choice.
